# Julain's Neovim Configuration

If starting from no custom Neovim config, you can just run
the following command to get started.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/juliancoleman/nvim-conf ~/.config/nvim
```

Once cloned, you can just start Neovim normally and let the
plugins do their thing.

If you're not starting from scratch, try your best to not
overwrite the contents of `~/.config/nvim`.
